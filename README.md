ReadyCheck development guide.

## Product Statement / Vision

The ReadyCheck is a mobile app that can initiate an automatic participation survey initiated by the survey owner for the members of a group.
All members of the group will get a popup window that asks if he/she is ready. The survey owner will get the results and 
can draw a Go/No Go conclusion based on the this.

## User Stories

### Create Group &lt;User Story&gt;

As a survey owner I would like to create a named group in order to initiate ready checks for all the participants 
of that group.

### Group approval &lt;User Story&gt;

As a user I would like to approve all my participation in ready checks in order to avoid spamming.

### Initiate Ready Check &lt;User Story&gt;

As a user I would like to initiate ready check in a group to see if we can start the activity.

### Response to a Ready Check &lt;User Story&gt;

As a user I would like to participate in ready checks with my answers.

### Draw conclusion &lt;User Story&gt;

As a ready check initiator I would like to draw a conclusion based on the ready check answers and give a go/no go
answer to the group.
